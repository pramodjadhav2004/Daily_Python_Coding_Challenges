"""
Given a string representing the time you set your alarm and a string 
representing the time you actually woke up, determine if you woke up early, 
on time, or late.

- Both times will be given in "HH:MM" 24-hour format.

Return:
- "early" if you woke up before your alarm time.
- "on time" if you woke up at your alarm time, or within the 10 minute 
  snooze window after the alarm time.
- "late" if you woke up more than 10 minutes after your alarm time.

Both times are on the same day.
